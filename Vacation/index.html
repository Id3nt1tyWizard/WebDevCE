        <h1>Welcome to Gray's Ski Recs</h1>
        <h2>Discover Your Next Powder Paradise</h2>
        <p>
            For over 15 years, Budget Vacations has been connecting adventure seekers with the world's most incredible ski destinations—without the luxury price tag. 
            I believe that epic powder days, breathtaking mountain views, and unforgettable alpine experiences shouldn't be reserved for the ultra-wealthy.
        </p>
        <h2>Who I Serve</h2>
        <p>
            I specialize in crafting affordable ski adventures for thrill-seekers, families, and groups who want authentic mountain experiences. Whether you're a seasoned shredder looking for untouched backcountry
            or a beginner ready to tackle your first green run, I'll find the perfect slope for your skill level and budget.
        </p>
        <h2>Hidden Gems, Big Adventures</h2>
        <p>
            Forget the overpriced mega-resorts. I've spent years uncovering hidden gem ski towns and under-the-radar mountain destinations across North America, Europe, and beyond. 
            From charming Slovenian villages to affordable Japanese powder towns, I'll show you where locals actually ski—places with shorter lift lines, cheaper lift tickets, 
            and way more character.
        </p>
        <h2>What Our Travelers Say</h2>
        <p>
            "Budget Vacations sent us to Revelstoke, BC and it completely changed how we think about ski trips. Incredible terrain, half the cost of Vail, and the town was so welcoming!" — Marcus & jen T., Portland <br>
            "I was skeptical about 'budget' skiing, but the resort in Andorra they recommended had better snow than anywhere I've been in Colorado. Plus, the après-ski scene was unbeatable." — Kevin R., Denver <br>
            "As a family of five, ski vacations always felt out of reach. Budget Vacations found us an amazing package in Quebec with equipment rentals included. The kids are already begging to go back!" — The Patterson Family, Chicago <br>
            Ready to trade the crowds for fresh tracks? Let me plan your next adventure.
